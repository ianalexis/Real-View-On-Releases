# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

1. **Branch Creation**: 
   - Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
   - Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the purpose of your changes.

2. **Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Once your changes are ready, open a Pull Request (PR) to the main branch.
   - In the PR description, clearly specify the objective of your changes and how they were implemented.
   - Ensure your PR includes any relevant information that will help reviewers understand your changes.

3. **Code Structure**:
   - Try to modify the existing code structure as little as possible.
   - If architectural changes are necessary, make sure to inform the team and provide a detailed explanation of the changes.

4. **Communication**:
   - Keep the team informed about your progress and any challenges you encounter.
   - Use the project's communication channels to discuss significant changes or seek feedback.
